>Average day for Anon at the local Rape Shelter in Equestria
>The Rape Shelter is a holy, sacred place, and you've been metagaming the hell out of it.
>Did Fluttershy approach you, or look in your general direction?
>Rape Shelter.
>Did you, after consuming unhealthy amounts of Applejack's hard apple cider, have an out of body experience that let you know she was nearby?
>Rape Shelter.
>Did Rainbow warn you about Fluttershy's newest fetish guess, and the EXACT time she'll head to your home, because she's an absolute bro?
>Rape.
>Shelter.
>You'd have found yourself soaked in sweat, drool, and mare juices a long, LONG time ago without it.
>Not even Twilight's scientific mind would be able to quantify the amount of bodily fluid.
>The Rape Shelter is none other than Twilight's Castle.
>And it "protects" you from that stupid, ridiculously determined, mare juice-dripping yellow horse.
>One day, when you needed it the most, the castle "saved" you, and you ended up abusing it to avoid Flubbercry ever since.
>It all started with that time you were helping Twilight out with an..."errand".
>It's a long story, and what happened during it was so traumatizing that you haven't told anyone about it.
>Mainly because it's your fault
>She basically sent you on a reconnaissance mission for the sole purpose of studying Zecora.
>Why?
>Because Twilight is a massive racist, and wouldn't touch her with a 10 foot pole.
>That would mean being in the presence of a "Zigger".
>Or worse, talking to one.
>It makes you wonder why she even bothered with that "School of Friendship" crap.
>Then again, all of the students' tests had questions like, "In a short paragraph, describe why you're inferior to ponies in every single way".
>Humans and Ponies are pretty much at top of their respective food chains, and maybe she can sense that.
>Her disdain for anything that's not a pony, or you, isn't the only thing she shares with you, and the list is pretty damn long.
>And unfortunately, Sluttershy also had a key role in this little mission.
>You and Twilight have learned (the hard way) that predators, especially bears, hate the absolute SHIT out of you.
>Not wanting her brand new monkey friend to get ripped apart on his way through Everfree Forest, she teamed you up with the animal hoers.
>No bear, wolf, lion, or any other dangerous creature would maul you to death if Fluttershy was there to calm them down.
>Any other time was different, as you could honestly just walk away from her.
>Or, you know, physically defend yourself like that "one" time.
>Thinking about it now makes you quake in your boots.
>That time, however, you would eventually find yourself at Fluttershy's mercy.

>You and Wubadubdub gathered all of your data, found out what a "marefare check" was, and hightailed it out of there before Zecora spotted you.
>Animals hate you just as well as they can sense you, but it seemed like that trip through the forest would've been painless that time.
>If you can call having to pry Fluttershy's face away from your crotch, and hearing her sniff you from afar painless.
>To your horror, TWO bears came out of seemingly nowhere, and you almost unironically shat yourself.
>You've seen the bullshit Fluttershy can pull with animals, but you were still scared for your life at the time.
>That's when Rapetholomew I of Rapestantinople initiated her full-proof plan.
>While you were farting, shitting, and cumming out of fear, Fluttershy turned to you.
>You'll never forget the words she said to you afterwards.
>"I-I'll make you a d-deal, Anon..."
>"...Either, t-take off your pants, or d-die."
"...Huh?"
>You stared at the yellow rapist for what felt like a solid minute, completely flabbergasted.
>At the time, you wondered if she really had it in her to threaten your life for some dick.
>It's entirely possible that she was bluffing, but you weren't willing to test that out.
>Fluttershy's proposition distracted you enough that the two bears' quickening advancement surprised you.
>In a matter of seconds, you would've been lunch, so there was no time to think.
>You never thought you'd be so apprehensive about unzipping your pants in front of a girl, but there you were.
>Your hands were shaking, you were sweating bullets, and it took much longer than it should have to free Anon Jr.
>"N-Now, I know you two don't like Anon, but give it some thought before you tear him to shreds."
>You were too busy pulling out Mr. President to notice it, but the bears were in deep thought after hearing Fluttershy's words.
>After placing reasonable doubt in their minds, Fluttershy was glaring at your crotch like a madman, drooling the entire time.
>Her eyes were as wide as dinner plates, and the floodgates had been opened.
>In other words, mare juice.
>Mare juice everywhere.
>When you were finished struggling, Fluttershy didn't waste any time.
>Before you knew it, you were getting the most extreme, hardcore SUCK of your life.
>Thinking about the fine details sends shivers down your spine to this day, but you remember it all.
>Flubbercry was devouring your hopes, your dreams, and everything that you ever loved.
>Birds and small critters of all kinds fled the area as your desperate cry for help echoed throughout Everfree Forest.
"HNNNNNGGHH"
>It wasn't really a cry for help, but it was the only thing you could manage.
>You were begging for some kind of god, maybe even Celestia, to save you.
>Just when you were about to show Fluttershy what Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing tastes like, your prayers were answered.

>In the strangest way imaginable.
>Some kind of trippy rainbow beam shot out of your chest, and flew off in some random direction.
>However, after a few moments, the direction didn't seem so random to you.
>It felt like it was flying off to Twilight's castle, but you still have no idea how you would've known that.
>Much like the after effects of overindulging on Applejack's hard cider, it felt like an out of body experience.
>The strangest thing happened immediately afterwards.
>Thomas The Rape Engine released you from her super mega ultra gorilla grip orifice, and was stood perfectly still.
>To be perfectly honest, it creeped you out.
>She was just standing there.
>No blinking, no movement, no nothing.
>Calling out to her didn't do anything, either.
>You also remembered that there's still two bears having a philosophical discussion with each other about the value of your life.
>It may have been cruel, but you didn't want to stick around to find out what the conclusion was, so you zipped back up and ran for it.
>Your first order of business after leaving The Statue of Rape in the woods was to return to Twilight.
>After telling her everything you learned, and agreeing with her about the inferiority of Zebras just to get things over with, she asked where Fluttershy was.
>You gave the most generic answer you could think of, like that she had to go feed Angel, or something.
>Twilight Spergle thanked you for your service, before hugging your leg.
"HNNNNNGGHH"
>-Was the sound you made after she did so.
>Even though she's autistic, extremely racist, and has several other issues with social interaction, she's far more likeable than Flubbercry.
>Of course, the unexplainable events didn't end there.
>Fluttershy would eventually snap out of whatever petrification-like state that she was in, and she too returned to Twilight's castle.
>What happened when she arrived is one of the weirdest, yet hilarious things you've ever seen.
>You excused yourself from the autistic purple horse, and decided it was as good a time as any to grab some grub.
>Your daily lunch with Rainbow was going to be heaven compared to what you had been through.
>A freshly cooked, hot meal with your bro would have been the perfect thing to erase every memory of what happened in that forest.
>Before you got around to any of that, you were stopped by Fluttershy at the door.
>Or more accurately, at the stairs.
>She was stood just in front of the first step, and for some reason, her body was jittering about.
>Rubber Flubber was sweating bullets just as hard as you were in the forest, and it was pretty fucking awkward.
"S-Sorry about leaving you in the forest back there, Fluttershy..."
>You rubbed the back of your head nervously, knowing it wasn't any good to leave her in that condition without knowing what caused it.
>Maybe, just maybe, that's what she deserved for holding you at bear-point and forcefully sucking you off in the woods, though.

>"...C-Can't come...any...closer..."
>Fluttershy's volume is usually never high.
>However, you could barely hear her just now.
>That's when it hit you.
>You remembered that random rainbow beam that shot out of your chest while you were getting molested.
>It HAD to be tied to the castle, and it seems like Flutter Butter has been banned from entering.
>While you stared at Fluttershy as she struggled to exist, Autism Supreme stepped beside you unannounced.
>"Anon?" Twilight asked, looking up at you. "What are you standing around in the doorway for?"
>You quickly looked down at her, jumping a little bit from the sudden surprise.
>After speaking, Twilight noticed Fluttershy at the bottom of the stairs.
>"...And what in the name of Equestria is going on here?!"
>Twilight's reaction was justified as Fluttershy's appearance was pretty ghastly by this point.
>The poor thing looked like she caught rabies.
>"Anon, I-I'm gonna f-f-f-fuck you s-so hard..." Fluttershy muttered, still shivering like she had seen a ghost.
>"PPFFFFT-HAAAAAAAAA!!!" Uproarious laughter had burst out from Twilight, who fell to the floor and rolled around.
>You were about to join her, but you suppressed the laugh as much as you could.
>Fluttershy was going to drain you dry if you dared to leave this castle, so you simply walked back inside.
"Uhm, hey, meet me inside, Twilight."
>Turning around, you walked back into the castle, waiting for Twiggles to finish laughing at Fluttershy.
>After a good three minutes, she finally had her fill and came back in.
>"Haaaahhh...I really needed that..." She was still recovering from her superlative laugh, the highest degree of laughter.
>"...Now, care to explain why Fluttershy is standing outside the castle like a weirdo and muttering obscenities at you?"
>Not wanting to tell Twilight the horrifying details of what happened in the woods, you ended up dismissing her question.
"She's just...really riled up, that's all."
>"Riled up is a bit of an understatement."
>As always, Twilight was skeptical and didn't find the answer to be something so simple.
"Well, I'm sure she'll be fine. Besides, me and Dash are supposed to be having our daily lunch soon. I'd rather not stick around for too long."
>"And how do you suppose you'll get past Fluttershy? I doubt she'll just let you walk past her in that state."
>Jumping out one of the castle windows would have been a terrible idea.
>That horse was on high alert mode, and if she didn't smell you, her marehood would have reacted to your human pheromones or some shit.
>The only viable option at the time was to call upon Twiggles for help.
"With YOUR help! Why don't you, uh...distract her for me? If you know what I mean?"
>"I had a feeling you would say that." Twilight sighed, beginning to step outside to buy you time.
>"Since you helped me out with that errand, consider us even, okay?"
"Hell yeah! You're the fuckin' best, Twilight! Maybe we can hang out sometime tomorrow?"
>"Sure, sure." Twilight replied, giggling in that nerdy, adorable way you've always liked.
>While she kept Fluttershy busy, you made your way to the back of the castle, and hopped outside through a window.
>That ends the magical, and mysterious origin story of the Rape Shelter.
>That was about a week ago, and you're currently huddled up in your safe zone.
>Your horny, foaming-at-the-mouth visitor is looking up at you as you look down at her.
>Whatever vile, indescribable thoughts going through her mind right now are beyond you.
>Twilight has seen her like this in front of her castle enough times that you owe her a real explanation, and that's okay.
>You've got to get this off your chest at some point.
>Turning away from the window, you head to Twilight's library, wondering in the back of your mind if it'll stay like this forever.

>Perhaps the most horrifying part of that experience was that you almost lost the game.
>If it weren't for this castle, you shudder to think how that would've ended.
>Because there's a good chance it wouldn't have stopped at Fluttershy's hot-dog eating competition.
>On your way to Twilight's book chambers, you whipped your head around at a familiar sight.
>It was that rainbow beam again, but this time, it was moving much, much slower.
>Considering this thing has something to do with this castle, you stopped what you were doing and followed.
>Maybe you can get some answers as to what the hell it even is, or why it decided to spare you.
>After a bit of following, you found yourself at the round table of the castle.
>The beam made contact with the table, turning on the map that Twilight had shown you many times before in the process.
>What's even weirder is that it was pinpointing a location.
>A very, very nearby location at that.
>You leaned in towards the map, before comically raising your eyebrow at it like The Rock.
>Fluttershy's cutie mark was hovering and spinning around this spot, just outside the castle.
>Was this motherfucking castle telling you Fluttershy's exact location?
>Your hands found themselves flat against the table as you leaned forward, taking a moment to process it all.
>The Elements of Harmony, those artifacts Twilight told you about, were warning you about a local rapist in your area.
>ONE of them, anyways.
>For right now, Fluttershy was by far the largest offender.
>Lyra was cutting it close a couple of times, but so far, her advances pale in comparison to Nutter Butter.
>That doesn't mean that it gets any less tiresome having to wipe her drool off your fingers all the time, though.
>Thinking about pony slobber brought your thoughts to that mishap in the woods.
>You really don't want to admit it, but you were enjoying it.
>Apart from one or two dates with your own species back on Earth, and one blowie, you haven't really done much with women.
>But Fluttershy was giving you the Super Mega Ultra God-Like Fist-Clenching Soul-Stealing Guak Guak 9,000.
>And you were no match for her apparent expertise.
>She must practice a lot, and it scares you to think about who, or what she's been practicing on.
>But does this mean you've got a rape fetish, or something?
>You can't tell a single soul about it if you do, because there's the tiniest chance Fluttershy would be there.
>Stalking you in the background, waiting and listening.
>She'd try to rape you regardless, but her knowing that little fact would make things so much worse.
>You were torn away from your train of thought when you noticed Fluttershy's location changing.
>It travelled further into Ponyville before slowly fading out.
>Not gonna' lie, that's ominous as fuck.
>Either way, this may or may not have escalated into a "Friendship Problem" or something.
>But as far as you're concerned, it's a state of national fucking emergecy.

>This makes telling Twilight even more of an obligation, so you leave the map in silence, heading to Book Horse's reading chamber.
>But not before stopping in the doorway and looking over your shoulder at the map in a movie-like fashion.
>Damn, you're smooth.
>No wonder so many mares want you so badly.
>Immediately after, some odd, sparkly shape started to materialize in front of the round table.
>It looked like some kind of projection of Fluttershy, with her rear end facing you.
>"G-Give me your hot monkey dick already."
>You jumped backwards as the ghost-like, sparkly Fluttershy spoke to you.
>Just as quickly as the apparition appeared, it left.
>You could have left the room WITHOUT seeing Fluttershy's ponut and winking pussy, but you digress.
>Man, the Tree of Harmony is fucking weird.
>Knocking on the wall just outside Twilight's library, you decided to toy with her a bit.
>She looked up from the same book she had been reading for a week straight now.
>"Finished having a staring contest with your #1 fan?"
>Raising a leg high into the air, you stepped into frame for comedic effect, revealing yourself.
"Yeah...see...about that..."
>The truth has to come out.
>Sooner rather than later.
>Twilight is a very autistic, but understanding horse.
>You're worried about nothing, honestly.
"...So, when me and Fluttershy were on our way back to Ponyville after running that errand for you..."
>"Mmmhmmm?" Twilight hummed in a dubious way, like she was teasing you.
"...Uhm, something happened. Something really bad. Like, Fluttershy threatening to let bears maul me for some dick levels of bad."
>"PPPFFFT-"
>Twilight did a spit-take of her tea, but quickly regained her composure and continued listening to you.
>With a smile on her face that suggests what she just did wasn't offensive or anything.
>You pinched the bridge of your nose and sighed before continuing on with your story.
"Anyways, she got what she wanted."
>"Got what she wanted? What's that supposed to mean, Mr. Human?"
>You hate it when she does this.
"She...She basically told me I'd die if I didn't take my cock out."
>"MmmMMmmmhmh..." Twilight placed a hoof over her mouth, struggling not to laugh at your misfortune.
"And...she started blowing me...."
>"PPFF-HAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!"
>She fell onto her back, rolling around on the floor as she suffered from side-splitting laughter.
>"OHHH, OH CELESTIA, IT HURTS! PFFHAHAAAAAAAAAAA-"
"Knock it off, alright? Do you have any idea how emasculating it is to get forcefully sucked off by a horse in the woods?!"
"I've never felt so powerless in my life!"
>Her stomach had to have been in pain by now, and you could see the tears in her eyes.
>You walked closer, standing above her as she tossed to and fro, and gave her the most disappointed look you could muster.
>"I-I'm sorry! It's just..."
"Twilight, please..."
>Sensing some hurt in your voice, she kept her mouth shut with magic, and picked herself back up.

>All while smiling like an idiot, of course.
>"Okay, okay, I'm done. Now, what happened after that?"
>Finally.
>She stopped.
"Thanks, Twi. Anyways, her little rape attempt got cut short after this weird beam came out of me.
>The sound of unicorn magic graced your ears again as she forcibly withheld her laughter.
"I don't mean like that, get your mind out of the gutter, Purple Smart."
>"A-And then?" Twilight, with a shaky voice.
"It was a magical rainbow or something, and it flew off to this castle."
>At some point, her curiosity overshadowed the urge to laugh at your pain.
"After that, Fluttershy was...petrified. I think?"
"She wasn't moving, or blinking, or anything. I tried to snap her out of it, but no dice."
"So I just cut my losses and got out of there as fast as I could since those bears were still on stand-by."
>"And that's when she started loitering outside my castle like a madmare?"
"Yep. What's even weirder is that the beam JUST lead me to the map while you were in here reading."
"Fluttershy's live location was on it and everything."
>"Wait, what? Why would the Elements of Harmony...?" Twilight looked so confused.
>You can't blame her, though.
>This is a pretty ridiculous situation.
"Of course, I'm not complaining about it, or anything."
>"Is the map still doing that right now?"
"Nope. At least, I don't think so. After a while, she walked away from the castle, and then the signal died."
>"Hmmm..."
>Wolfgang Autism Mozart scratched her chin with a hoof, trying to find an explanation for all of this.
"We can go check now if you want, maybe she's back outside."
>"I was thinking the same thing. Let's go take a look."
>Twilight trotted off at a quick pace towards the atrium, and you followed behind.
>And you totally weren't staring at her fat, purple ass on the way there.
>All of that low physical activity, and sitting around wasn't doing her body fat any favors.
>For all intents and purpose, you absolutely would.
>You really would.
>Once the two of you arrived at your destination, you briefly looked over the map.
>Nothing.
>"And you're sure that the map was showing you where Fluttershy was? You weren't mistaken, or anything?"
"If I'm mistaken, then I must be fucking crazy or something, because it looked pretty real to me..."
>With perfect, uncanny timing, you overheard Rainbow calling out to you through the halls.
>She flew into the room, greeting the two of you.
>It was almost time for your daily lunch with Rainbro, so it looks like she came to you this time.
>It's no surprise that she knew where to look, too.
>You've been hanging out at the Rape Shelter more often than your own home at this point.
>"H-Hey Twi. Hey, Anon...have you two seen Fluttershy today?"
"Uhhh...yeah. Why do you ask?"
>"Well, I saw her outside the castle standing in a puddle of...uh..."
"Mare juice?"
>"D-Don't say it like that! What the heck is wrong with you?!"
>Rainbow's voice cracked, and she was blushing profusely.

>"P-Put a sock in it! Now, do you either of you know what's wrong with her? She wouldn't even respond to me!"
>You might as well tell her, too.
>But you'll just give her the short version.
>Her little heart probably wouldn't be able to handle the full story.
"Long story short, the Elements of Harmony are stopping Fluttershy from coming into the castle."
"...And also, proooobably protecting me from getting raped."
>"WHAT?!" Rainbow shouted, almost piercing your ear drums.
"I mean, it's not that hard to believe. Fluttershy's advances are obviously affecting our friendship."
>"You really think this is a friendship problem, or something?"
>Rainbow couldn't believe what she was hearing, and Twilight looked like she was cooking up schemes.
"Twilight, what's with that look on your face?"
>"Oh! Nothing! I'm just...thinking..."
>"Think about it later, egghead! It's almost time for lunch!"
>She was right.
>But that's what scares you.
>She'll probably have to get distracted again so you can leave this castle un-molested.
>"Anon, I have an idea. You might not like it, but it's the right thing to do."
>Oh no.
>You seriously hope she wasn't about to say it.
>"The three of us can go out to lunch, but Fluttershy has to come with us."
>Her purple hoof clopped against the floor, emphasizing her words.
>That's exactly what you were afraid of.
>Ever since you discovered the Rape Shelter's almighty field of protection, you've avoided Fluttershy.
>That means no conversations, no casual greetings, or anything like that.
>Imagine hanging around someone who's been staring at you the way she has been for the past week.
>Hell, imagine hanging around someone who used angry bears against you as a bargaining chip for her sexual desires.
>It was the last thing you wanted to do at this point, friendship problem or not.
"Ughh...alright, fine."
>"Don't worry, bro! We've got your back!" Dash winked, bumping you with her elbow.
>Or her knee?
>Whatever the hell it is.
>Her enthusiasm is therapeutic, and even though it's embarrassing, it's giving you confidence.
>You run your hands through Fast Horse's mane, petting her like you would a house pet back on Earth.
>"W-What's the big idea, huh? Why do you always start petting me like this...?"
"Just felt like doing it. It's a bro thing, y'know?"
>"Sure, whatever..." She pretended not to like it, but you can tell she was moving into your hands.
>You didn't notice, but Twilight had a bit of an envious look on her face.
>It's impossible for anypony to not know about your bromance with Rainbow.
>There isn't a single day you aren't spending time with her.
>With this whole "friendship problem" fiasco, you've been spending more time with Twilight, too.
>Still, it's not wrong to think Twilight wanted just as much attention from you, if not more.

>"Alright, Mr. Human. Just stick with us, and you'll be just fine." Twilight spoke up, before turning around.
>Twi started to leave the castle, Rainbow flew after her, and you soon followed.
>It's not like you were opposed to being friends with Fluttershy, not at all.
>She was actually really pleasant during your first week in Horse World.
>But after a few missing pieces of underwear, love letters soaked with juices, and unwarranted ass groping, things got weird.
>Fast.
>Eventually bringing you to the way things are now, and you're not happy about it.
>You let Twilight and Rainbow be the first to leave the castle, while you peeked through the doorway.
>Just in time to see Fluttershy's eyes lock onto you.
>It was like something out of a horror movie.
>The yellow pony didn't react in any way to Twi or Dash, as if they weren't even there.
>"Quit bein' such a baby, Anon! If she does anything crazy, I'll teach her a lesson."
>You've essentially got two bodyguards, so being this worried is a tad bit illogical.
>Stepping one foot onto the stairs, Fluttershy also stepped forward ever so slightly.
>Doing your best to ignore that, you make your way further down the steps.
>For some reason, you were suddenly filled with morbidly curiousity.
>Along with a confidence boost from having the Globgogabgalab and Sonic The Hedgehog by your side.
>In a way that completely betrayed your previous display of fear, you darted past Fluttershy as quickly as you could.
>To your horror, Fluttershy turned around on a dime.
>Your heart dropped when you looked back to see her running after you.
>Not flying.
>RUNNING.
>AT FULL SPEED.
"Dash?! TWILIGHT?! PLEASE?!"
>You regret everything you've ever done, ever.
>If you didn't use the restroom a while ago, you'd have pissed yourself.
>You shrieked at the top of your lungs, begging for them to stop her.
>"W-We're on it!" Rainbow dashed after John Carpenter's The Rapist, and Twilight slowed her down with magic.
>Key word, SLOWED her down.
>As powerful as Twilight's magic was, she was struggling to restrain this horse.
>"Why...is she...so...strong?!" Twilight felt herself being physically pulled; That's how relentless Fluttershy was.
>If Fluttershy were to get a hold of you in that state, your pelvis would be pounded into fucking dust.

>Once Rainbow caught up to her, she tackled Flubbercry to the ground, tumbling along the dirt path.
>You didn't stop running, though.
>Not for a while.
>Just to confirm that she was undeniably, 100% restrained.
>The teamwork between Twi and Dash seemed to be enough to hold Fluttershy still.
>"Okay, that's enough! Snap out of it, will ya'?!" Rainbow raised a hoof, and literally "slapped" the crazy out of her.
>A moment later, Fluttershy shook her head, and looked around like she was lost or something.
>"W-W-What's g-going on?! Where am I?" It was like she was an entirely different person.
>"Rainbow, why are you on top of me...?"
>"Because you were chasing Anon into Ponyville like a maniac! What's gotten into you?!"
>"I...I..."
>Reese's Peanut Flutter Cups was at a loss for words.
>It's definitely not an act, as far as you could tell.
>Dash got off of her, allowing Fluttershy to stand on shaky feet.
>"Fluttershy, what was the last thing you remember doing?"
>Twilight caught up to the three of you, keeping her magic at the ready just in case.
>"I...feel awful. The last thing I remember was...um...coming back to Ponyville with Anon..."
>Wait, what?
>Coming back to Ponyville with you?
>Twi's pupils shrank, as she realized it at the same time you did.
>Has she been in a lust-induced stupor for an entire week?
>Did the Tree of Harmony freezing her in place back in the forest fry her fucking brain?
"Uh-huh. Well, we took care of the errand, just so you know."
>"Oh, that's good to hear." She's as docile as she usually would be, so maybe it's "safe" for now.
>Fluttershy was never brave enough to pull any of the rapey stuff in public or around others.
>It makes you wonder what would happen if you turned and went back into the castle.
>You've already made one grave mistake today, so you shouldn't test your luck any further.
>"Listen, I bet you and Anon already had this conversation, but I'm lost here."
>You and Twi simply looked elsewhere, whistling comedically like you were both in a cartoon.
>"Buck it, let's just go get lunch." Dash gave up on trying to understand, and walked off.
"Wait, where are we going for lunch?"
>"Taco Del Pone, duh! Did you even write that down on your calender?"
>You forgot that you'd plan where you'd eat with Rainbow ahead of time, and make notes about it to remember.
>Sometimes it's a routine thing where the restaurants cycle daily, sometimes it's random.
"Oh, right...Sorry, I'm just recovering from the traumatizing event that just happened."
>"Oooh, I love Taco Del Pone! But I probably shouldn't eat too much. Their food doesn't sit well with me..."
>Fluttershy's stomach, with uncanny timing, growled loud enough to make the three of you jump.

"Yeah? Well, something tells me you should eat as much as you can."
>"M-Maybe you're right. I do feel pretty hungry..."
>Pretty hungry?
>She probably hasn't eaten properly in a week.
>And she hasn't been standing outside Twilight's castle 24/7 either, so you have no idea what else she's been up to.
>"I think we could all use a good lunch." Twi added, following after Dash.
>Fluttershy looked at Purple Smart, and then back to you.
>This was incredibly awkward, since she might remember just as much as you did.
>"A-Anon, I'm sorry for doing that to you earlier. I was really pent up..."
>And that basically confirmed it.
>At least she had the decency to apologize.
"Mmmm...I don't know if I should accept your apology, but it's water under the bridge for now.
"As long as you understand that threatening me with death is off the table. Same for everything else."
>"B-But..."
"No buts."
>"But I see you staring at other mares' butts all the time...Why not mine?"
"That's not what I meant by that. Also, most other mares have the decency to ask me things nicely."
"Y'know, instead of-"
>"I get it...I won't do it again..."
"Good. It's surprising how far you'll go in life by asking nicely. You should try it sometime."
>"F-Fuck me."
>You give up.
>Without looking to see if she's following behind, you jogged to catch up with Autism and Fast.
>The path to Taco Del Pone would've taken about fifteen minutes to walk to, so it wouldn't be a long trip.
>Ponyville was just as bustling and lively as ever, and the four of you engaged in casual conversation as you walked.
>One of your favorite mailmares, Derpy, flew overhead and waved at you.
>You waved back, smiling warmly.
>You love that stupid, unreasonably attractive, lazy-eyed horse.
>A while after, you spotted another one of your small, equine friends.
>It was Pinkie, but something was considerably off about her.
>She looked like she was depressed, with baggy eyes, walking while looking at the ground.
>Excusing yourself from the group for a moment, you approached her.
"Uhhh, Pinkie? Are you good?"
>"Oh...Hey, Nonny...I haven't been able to get much sleep..."
"Jesus, you sound like a zombie. No offense."
>"It's okay. Fluttershy's been keeping me up all night for the past week."
"What? Fluttershy? What the hell has she been doing to you?"
>"I-I don't wanna' talk about it. I feel...violated. A-Anways, I've gotta get over to Rarity's. Sorry, Nonny..."
>With that, Pinkie continued her walk of shame in the direction of Rarity's boutique.

>Is that what Fluttershy's been doing this past week when she wasn't stalking you outside the castle?
>While she was in THAT state?
"I'll catch you later, Pinkie! I'll drop by Sugarcube Corner soon, okay?"
>She kept walking on, looking back to acknowledge you, but didn't reply.
>Did Fluttershy...?
>The thought of it gives you dirty ideas and disgusted shivers at the same time.
>There's definitely something wrong with you.
>Now is the WORST time to pitch a tent, so you slap yourself before returning to the others.
>Bad Anon.
>There's a time and place for everything.
>Still, you'll have to give Fluttershy a piece of your mind for doing such a thing to Ponka.
>Targeting you was bad enough, but now she's going after her other friends?
>For shame.
>"W-What was the hold up, Anon?" Rapetholomew asked, as you jogged up behind the group.
"Nothing. Just wanted to say hi to somepony."
>It'd be best not to tell the others about it for now, since Pinkie looked so exhausted.
>Her friends worrying about her would make a bad situation worse.
>Before long, the four of you entered into Taco Del Pone.
>"ssnnniiiIIIFFFFF...Haaaaaa...Smells good!" Rainbow inhaled deeply, enjoying the mouth-watering smell of fast food.
>"I heard they added a new menu option! Wanna' try it out with me, Anon?" Twi asked, smiling cutely at you.
"Eh, why not? I order the same thing every time I come here anyway. As long as it doesn't have hay or grass in it."
>"Well, wouldya' look at that? Howdy, y'all! And it's good to see you too, Mr. Anonymous. I had fun drinkin' last week."
>The familiar voice of a hard-working, orange horse with a southern accent graced your ears.
>"Applejack! I haven't seen you in a while. I guess it's my fault for getting so absorbed in my books."
>"H-Hi, Applejack. It's good to see you..." Fluttershy spoke in her typical quiet horse voice.
>"Yo, what's up, AJ?" Rainbow took a seat next to Apple Horse, before pointing a hoof at Twi.
>"Hey, Twi, you remember what the rest of us usually get, right? Do me a solid and order for us!" Dash said to Twi.
>"Sure. Don't blame me if you change your mind later, though."
"We should hang out at the again sometime soon, AJ. Looks like the whole horse gang is here except for Pinkie and Rarity."
>"Yup. And it's a darn shame Spike is off at the Crystal Empire havin' an audience with Cadence."
>That reminds you.
>Twilight might have asked Spike to run that "errand" for her if he wasn't in Crystal Town.
>Hopefully everything is okay over there.
>But now isn't the time to worry about this or that, it's time to eat.
>And eat you did.
>It was the best meal you've had in a long time, accompanied with plenty of laughter and banter.

>Fluttershy was mostly quiet the entire time.
>That was when you noticed she wasn't actually sitting in her seat.
>Even the others were too busy chatting and gossiping to notice.
>You put down your Menu Item #12, Meat-Substitute Burrito(TM) to look around for her.
>Just then, you felt the familiar feeling of a snout jamming itself into your groin.
>Much to your dismay, the sudden touch on Anon Jr. made him excited.
>Resting an arm on the table, you dipped your head underneath it to see a Yellow Retard drooling on your crotch.
"Are you fucking kidding me? Get! Go on, get!"
>You swatted her face away with your hand, even going as far as pushing her away with your palm.
>"Y-You're getting hard, Anon. G-go on, just fuck my mouth..."
>This damn horse was getting braver and braver by the day.
>And the worst part is that you thought about it.
>Honestly, that means she's already won the battle.
>But not the war.
>You won't fall victim to her feminine wiles today.
>No, sir.
>She spoke just loud enough for you and you alone to hear it amidst the sounds of nearby conversation.
"I swear to Celestia, if you don't get off me, I'll fucking KILL YOU."
>"Uhh, what was that, Anon?" Applejack turned to face you, as did the others.
>You were a little too loud at the end of your sentence.
>Fluttershy retreated back to her chair, acting as if her butt never left the seat to begin with.
>Speaking of that chair, it's probably soaked in Flutter Juice(TM) right now.
"N-Nothing! Ignore what I said! I just remembered that I left my...uh...wallet at home! Yep. Silly me..."
>"Oooook. Anyways, like I was tellin' y'all, Big Mac showed up with this huge..."
>AJ continued on with her story, as the others redirected their attention back to her and their food.
>Out of the corner of your eye, you noticed Fluttershy giving you the most diabolical look.
>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AuoCww6Dtw 
>A dubious little creature, getting up to mischief.
>This is no good.
>Then you saw the peculiar way her hoof was moving, and you realized what she was doing with it under the table.
>All while looking you dead in the eyes, like she wants you to know what she's doing.
>Ugh.
>The beast is demonic in nature.
>Very icky.
>No good.
>Surely, this small momentary victory, if you can even call it that, was far from the end.
>The war on Rape still rages on, but the rest is a tale for another day.
